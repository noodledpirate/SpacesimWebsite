Education is a fundamental part of Spacesim, and is promoted both internally, within our club, and externally through our Elementary Education Programs.

EEPs are given by Spacesim members, and are exceptionally fun and engaging for both their audiences and presenters. Demonstrations take concepts of astronomy, physics and space travel, and break them down for younger audiences in ways that are easier to understand, and make learning enjoyable.

Presentations can be adjusted to cover specific topics, and for children of different ages and levels of understanding. These presentations are available for elementary school classes, day camps, and other private groups. Below is a list of demonstrations we currently offer, including the average amount of time each takes.
