In our Newtonâ€™s Laws demonstration, presenters teach the basic properties of motion: inertia, friction, and momentum. Our hovercraft is frequently used to model motion in a frictionless environment, and how this affects astronauts working in space. Audience members are encouraged to take part in the demonstration, and extra time can be given for hovercraft rides at the end of the presentation. (30-45 min.)
