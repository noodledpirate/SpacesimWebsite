In this demonstration, presenters will teach their audience about why the moon appears to change its shape over the course of a month and the names of the moon in each of its phases. Presenters also explain why some constellations are only visible at certain times of year, how the rotation of the Earth on its axis causes our cycle of day and night, and how its tilt causes seasonal changes. This is an excellent presentation for younger audiences, who are beginning to develop and interest in astronomy. (20-30 min.)
