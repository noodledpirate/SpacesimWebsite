In the planetarium, presenters teach the names of several constellations which are visible in the night sky at that time of year, and show how to find them using ‘pointer stars’ found in the Big Dipper. The presentation includes short lessons on the colours of stars, and the brightness at which we perceive them, based on their size, distance and luminosity. Lenses representing specific planets can also be inserted into our projection to depict the movement of planets in the night sky, and to demonstrate retrograde motion. The dome can be set up in a large room (such as a gymnasium, auditorium stage, or mid-sized classroom) with about 7 meters of floor space, and 3 meters of clearance from the ceiling. Planetariums are easily our most popular presentation, and are suitable for audiences of all ages. (45-60 min.)
